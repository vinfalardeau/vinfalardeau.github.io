Hello, I'm Sylvie Falardeau (they/she), a trans/vegan/anarchist geographer interested in cartography, remote sensing of the environment, and spatial thinking about injustice. This is Lilac Maps, a place where I stash maps for later, make my work accessible, and organize my portfolio. My earlier work can be found under the name Vincent Falardeau.

Check out two of my largest professional projects in my [Professional Portfolio](professional.md), the Midcoast Conservancy's 30x30 Landscape Priority Assessment and the Texas Coastal Bird Explorer for Audubon Texas.

This website began as an unedited portfolio of my course work from Professor Joseph Holler's GEOG 0323, offered at Middlebury College in Spring 2021. Find that portfolio [here](opensource.html). Two of my favorite remote sensing projects, under the advising and guidance of Professor Niwaeli Kimambo, can be found [here](remote.html).
