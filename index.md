Hello, I'm Sylvie Falardeau (they/she), a trans/vegan/anarchist geographer interested in cartography, remote sensing of the environment, and spatial thinking about injustice.

This website began as an unedited portfolio of my course work from Professor Joseph Holler's GEOG 0323, offered at Middlebury College in Spring 2021. Find that portfolio [here](opensource.html). Two of my favorite remote sensing projects, under the advising and guidance of Professor Niwaeli Kimambo, can be found [here](portfolio.html).
